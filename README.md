# Notebook #1: Python, Pandas, and Pokemon, Oh My!

<b>Due</b>: Thursday, January 5th, 2023  by 11:59 pm

## How this is going to work: 

To submit this notebook, please copy and paste the URL from this page (it should look something like: https://github.com/j23-cs167/notebook-1-YourGithubNameHere) to the Blackboard assignment before the due date.

I've provided some starter code for you. Before you go any further, click on the `notebook1_starter.ipynb` link in the repository, and then, at the top of the notebook, you will see a button that says `Open in Colab`. Click on this and it will open the starter code in Google Colaboratory.

> __warning__: changes are not saved automatically in Colab. It is a good idea to go to __File--> Save a Copy in Drive__ and/or __File --> 'Save a Copy in GitHub'__ option when you make a significant change.  
- If you choose __Save a copy in Drive__, it will save to your Google Drive, however, if you choose __'Save a Copy in Github__, it will automatically updated your Github respository.
- You will submit your notebook using the __File-->Save a Copy in Github__ option, but I recommend you save your progress to GitHub incrementally rather than pushing your code to GitHub right before the deadline.

## The Data
For this notebook, we're going to enter the world of Pokemon.

The data is from Kaggle, and can be found in this repository, on blackboard, and online at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon).
The data includes the following features:
- **#**: ID for each pokemon
- **Name**: Name of each pokemon
- **Type 1**: Each pokemon has a type, this determines weakness/resistance to attacks
- **Type 2**: Some pokemon are dual type and have 2
- **Total**: sum of all stats that come after this, a general guide to how strong a pokemon is
- **HP**: hit points, or health, defines how much damage a pokemon can withstand before fainting
- **Attack**: the base modifier for normal attacks (eg. Scratch, Punch)
- **Defense**: the base damage resistance against normal attacks
- **SP Atk**: special attack, the base modifier for special attacks (e.g. fire blast, bubble beam)
- **SP Def**: the base damage resistance against special attacks
 -**Speed*and *: determines which pokemon attacks first each round
 
The first step is to get the data loaded and ready to go, make sure the data is in your Google Drive and mount your Drive to the notebook. Start by printing out the first several lines of the dataset to get an idea of what the data looks like. 

## What you need to do :exclamation:
<b>Notebook #1 consists of the following exercises</b> [ 1 point each ]:
1. Print out all of the unique values for the `Type 1` column of the dataset. 
  > *Hint: I'm looking for each possible primary type to be ouput once, not a list of primary type of each pokemon. For example, if I tossed a coin 3 times and got Heads, Tails, Heads, the unique values of the coin flip are Heads and Tails. There is a function for this.*
2. Create a subset of data representing pokemon whose primary type is **Fire** ðŸ”¥, and the second type is **Flying** ðŸ¦…. Save this DataFrame to the variable name `fire_flying_pokemon`. Display the first 5 lines of this subset.
3. Using `fire_flying_pokemon`, what is the median **Attack** of Fire Flying Pokemon?
4. Create a subset with only pokemon from Generation I. Include 5 columns, the `Generation`, `Name`, `Type 1`, `Type 2`, and `Total`. 
  - *For an extra challenge, see if you can do this in one line.*
5. Which primary type of pokemon is the overall strongest? (not looking for philsophical debates here, I'm looking at the average of the 'Total' column, [grouped by](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html) Type--so Fire v Water v Grass etc.). 
6. **Do something cool**. Using the Pokemon dataset, get creative and show me something about the dataset. Use a text cell to explain what you did. 
 - *Need some help gettting started here? Try asking a question about the dataset and see if you can use Python and Pandas to answer the question*

Use a Markup cell to put your name at the top of the file. Submit this assignment through the GitHub Classroom link.

## :white_check_mark: Grading: 
I will update the following rubric with your grade after you have completed the assignment.
